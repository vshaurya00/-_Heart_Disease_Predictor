# ❤️_Heart_Disease_Prediction
An end-to-end Machine Learning project for predicting the likelihood of heart disease, deployed with Streamlit.

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
It includes data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation — all in a single Jupyter Notebook.  
A simple Streamlit app is also included for interactive predictions.
